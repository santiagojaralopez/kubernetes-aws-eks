# Deployment project with AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service

This project is a cloud-native Python API designed to run both locally (using Minikube/Kind) and on AWS EKS. It showcases modern deployment practices using Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

**Key Features:**
- **Containerized Python API:** Developed in Python and packaged with Docker.
- **Kubernetes Deployment:** YAML manifests to deploy the API on local clusters and AWS EKS.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Provision AWS resources (VPC, subnets, EKS cluster, etc.) using Terraform.
- **Automation Scripts:** Bash scripts to streamline build, push, and deployment processes.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions automates testing, building, and deployment on every push.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Docker
- Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
- Terraform
- Bash Scripting
- GitHub Actions
